# Sent.Ai.rt - A Real Time Interactive Portrait

A real-time camera feed that detects human emotion and adapts the style of the feed in relation to the emotion to create a 
picture that is in a style representative of the person’s mood.

Extra Feature 1 : Play back music that relates to the emotion? (This is almost done woot)

Extra Feature 2 : Save and Tweet out the picture using a Twitter Bot.

In technical lingo, it’s capturing real-time video to perform sentiment analysis followed by neural style transfer 
based on the output from the analysis.
